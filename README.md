# *myfreecadlib*
# Background
This repo is a personal library of functions for the CAD development software *FreeCAD*. Work in-progress.

# Installation
First, download and store this repository anywhere on your computer. Note the path to the repo's parent folder. 

Next, since myfreecad has yet to provide sufficitent documentation on creating and importing 3rd-party python modules, the follwing set of installation instructions must be performed *every time you import this library*. 
1. Open FreeCAD and exectue `setup.py` as a macro. 
2. Input the parent folder path into FreeCAD's Python console. 
3. `import myfreecadlib` using the Python console. It is reccomended you `import myfreecadlib as mfl` as this abrreviation is used throughout the rest of the documentation. 

# Usage
You may now call functions from `functions.py` using FreeCAD's Python console.
